Hi, I'm Ferdy Rodriguez, hope you enjoy your stay. I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience, the last couple of years I've been focusing in Android development. I'm still learing a lot, especially on topics about testing, architecture, and good practices.

In this blog I'll mainly be posting about things that I learn along the way, so that I can check them out if I ever forget how to do/use them. I do hope that my ramblings can help you in any way. If you want to contact me you can reach me on my social networks, the links that are in the sidebar of this blog.

On a personal note, I love sports especially football and American football (#GoPackers). 

Cheers!
