## Me
Hi, I'm Ferdy Rodriguez, a software developer with 5 years of experience. The first 3 years doing web development, but since than I've focused in Android Development. Still learing a lot, especially in topics about testing, architecture, and good practices.

This blog will mainly be a log about things that I learned and help me remenber them. But I hope that it will also help the readers, *if there are any*. If you want to contact me, you can reach me out in my social networks links that are in the sidebar.

I also loved sports, especially football (**rest-of-the-world**)  and American football (#GoPackers).

Cheers!
